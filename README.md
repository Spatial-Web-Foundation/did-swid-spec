## Abstract

`did:swid` is a [DID method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.1/#methods) for the [Spatial Web](https://spatialwebfoundation.org/),
with the following design goals and properties:

- All Spatial Web Entities (including Credentials) have SWIDs.
- The Spatial Web SWID Registry ensures uniqueness of the SWIDs.
- Most SWIDs will be created by a DID Issuer at behest of the Entity and not recorded in a centralized registry.
- The Spatial Web will include Entities with DIDs created without interaction with any particular authority.
