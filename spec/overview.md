## Overview

This specification defines the `did:swid` method for [[ref: Decentralized Identifiers]] (DIDs).
DIDs using this method can be used as "Spatial Web Identifiers (SWIDs)", see [[spec: SWIDS-AND-SWID-DOCUMENTS]].

The Spatial Web will use SWIDs as identifiers.

The `did:swid` method leverages a registry known as Spatial Web SWID Registry, which is
managed by a Designated Authority.
